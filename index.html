<p>
This website was created in an effort to best display my genealogiacal
findings. It would be great to hear from you about what you may know that isn't
on the site. If you wish to suggest anything then you can make your way to the
contribute section on the left.

<p>
If you would like the details of a living family member made private then I
would be more than happy to do that.
